# 🎲 Random Activity Generator website 

A fun and interactive web application that helps users discover random activities based on the number of participants and category preferences. Built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **EJS**, it fetches real-time data using the **Bored API** and showcases the use of **middlewares**, **body-parser**, **Axios**, and **async/await** with **error handling**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack Used

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **Axios** – For making HTTP requests to the public Bored API
- **EJS** – Templating engine for rendering dynamic content
- **Body-Parser** – To parse form data
- **Middleware** – For handling requests and responses
- **Async/Await** – To handle asynchronous code
- **Try/Catch** – For error handling

---

## 🚀 Features

- Users can enter the **number of participants**.
- Users can **select a type of activity** (e.g., education, recreational, social, etc.).
- Fetches **random activity suggestions** from the [Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com/).
- Handles errors gracefully using `try/catch`.
- Renders clean UI using EJS.
